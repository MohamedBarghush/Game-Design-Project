**Obelion: Rise to be The Game Master** is a souls-like open-world action RPG that begins your journey in the shattered realm of Obelion — a fantasy world on the brink of chaos.

While the grand vision includes multiple factions, evolving AI, and dynamic class-based gameplay, this early build focuses on introducing players to the world through a dramatic opening scenario filled with tension, action, and mystery.

## Early Gameplay Experience

- Start your adventure accompanied by **Justice**, an intelligent spirit companion powered by a large language model (LLM).  
- Justice guides you through movement, combat, and game mechanics in an immersive tutorial and dynamically interacts with you, setting the emotional and narrative tone.  
- Follow Justice to a village under siege, engaging in real-time action combat against invading monsters.  
- Meet **Sakura**, an NPC also powered by an LLM and enhanced with text-to-speech (TTS), who interacts dynamically and sets your next objective: confronting the powerful regional boss, **Loki**.

## Core Pillars

- Intelligent companions driven by AI and LLM technology  
- Cinematic storytelling with dynamic, immersive dialogue  
- Real-time action combat gameplay  

## Roadmap & Vision

The full faction system, adaptive AI, and class-based progression are part of the broader roadmap. This early build offers a glimpse into Obelion’s core pillars as you prepare to face the enigmatic Game Master.
